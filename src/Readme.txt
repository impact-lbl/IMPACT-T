Note: 
1) The current version of the code is for serial single processor computer
with Fortran90 compiler.
To run the code on a parallel computer with MPI, the user has to
specify the flag "USE_MPI=1" along with a MPI compatible compiler and linker via
 the FC and LINK flags when invoking make, e.g. make FC=mpif90 LINK=mpif90 USE_MPI=1.
For CMake users just need to specify "-DUSE_MPI=1" when invoking cmake.
2) The phaseOpt.py is used to find the driven phase of a RF cavity with initial 
design phase. This code needs to be modified for each input ImpactT.in file
in order to use it correctly.
3)The subroutines in FFT.f90: realft, four1, and sinft,
can be replaced with functions from the Numerical Recipe or some 
equavilent 1D FFT functions.
4) There are two backup Makefiles (MakefileS_backup and MakefileP_backup)
using "make" in case the "cmake" does not work.
To use the parallel version Makefile, one needs comment out "use mpistub" in 5 
source files:
(Contrl/Input.f90:        use mpistub 
DataStruct/Data.f90:        use mpistub
DataStruct/Pgrid.f90:        use mpistub
DataStruct/PhysConst.f90:        use mpistub
Func/Timer.f90:        use mpistub)
and rename the mpif.h file as mpif.hh.
